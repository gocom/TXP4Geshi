h1. TXP4Geshi

p. "Textpattern CMS":http://textpattern.com v4.x tag syntax definitions for "GeSHI":http://qbnz.com/highlighter/ (Generic Syntax Highlighter) v1.0.8

p. Consider the project/definition file experimental and totally untested. Well, it's tested and used by me, but the results might not be exactly perfect.

h2. Features

* Supports core attributes and tags as of Textpattern v4.4.1.
* In addition to Textpattern tags, highlights and supports HTML5 attributes and tags.
* Links TXP's core tags to "Textpattern User Documentation":http://textpattern.net.
* HTML5 tags are linked to "December Communications, Inc":http://december.com.

h2. Drawbacks

* While plugin-added tags are highlighted, these non-core tags won't be linked or referenced.
* Nesting and tags-as-attributes (or as known, tags in tags) can cause variating results.

h2. Requirements

* GeSHi v1.0.8 (note: TXP4Geshi is not for GeSHi v1.1.x).

h2. Notes

* "txp:hide":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=hide is treated as a block comment.

h2. Included files explained:

* txp.php - the syntax definition file. Should be placed to GeSHI language definitions directory. The definition's name is _txp_.
* ref/listAtts - for generating list of tag attributes used in taghandles.php.
* ref/listFunctions - for generating list of functions defined in taghandlers.php.
