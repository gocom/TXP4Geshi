Textpattern CMS tag syntax definitions for GeSHI (Generic Syntax Highlighter) v1.0.8

Textpattern - http://textpattern.com
GeSHI - http://qbnz.com/highlighter/

Consider the project/definition file experimental and totally untested. Well, it's tested and used by me, but the results might not be exactly perfect.

* Supports core attributes and tags as of Textpattern v4.4.1.
* In addition to Textpattern tags, highlights and supports HTML5 attributes and tags.
* Links core tags to Textpattern User Documentation - http://textpattern.net
* HTML5 tags are linked to December Communications, Inc - http://december.com

Drawbacks:

* While the syntax is highlighted, plugin tags won't be linked as that wouldn't be possible.
* Nesting and tags-as-attributes can cause variating results.

Requirements:

* GeSHi v1.0.8 (note: not for 1.1.x).

Notes:

* txp:hide - http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=hide - is treated as a block comment.

Included files explained:

* txp.php - the syntax definition files. Should be placed to your GeSHI language definitions directory. Definition's name is txp.
* ref/listAtts - for generating list of tag attributes used in taghandles.php.
* ref/listFunctions - for generating list of functions defined in taghandlers.php.
